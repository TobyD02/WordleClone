# WORDLE Clone

Open the index.html file to begin playing

## How to play

Each day a new word is selected. You have 6 guesses to try and figure out which 5 letter word it is. In order to guess, simply begin typing on your keyboard. Backspace will remove the most recent letter, and enter will submit your guess so long as the guess is a valid 5 letter word. After making a guess, each tile will be lit with a colour: green indicating the correct letter in the correct position, amber indicating the correct letter in an incorrect position, and black indicating that the letter isnt in the word.

## Future developments
- Modify how random words are selected, currently the formula being used is too predictable.
- Add functionality for stats to be recorded: 
    - If you have already played today then your progress should be remembered/tracked
    - Store a counter for how many correct guesses you have made in your lifetime, and keep track of how many guesses it has taken you.
    - Show correct answer if it isn't guessed correctly.
